# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this weeks challenge we focused on SQLAlchemy which is pulling info from a database. Throughout the challenge I queried my info by running "session.query". The session.query was ike a buliding blcok for me to further my analysis throughout the challenge. I also had to use prior knowledge from previous lessons to plot my graphs.
